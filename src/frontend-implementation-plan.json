Use the existing HUD color scheme from CSS variables and maintain consistency with the current HEV aesthetic. Add progress percentage display. Ensure animations respect the prefers-reduced-motion media query. Synchronize visual stage transitions with voice narration timing using the same timing logic. Maintain smooth fade-out and completion callback behavior."
