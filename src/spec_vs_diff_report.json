  "summary": "Diff propagates `tactical-panel` styling to several non-tactical tabs (Basics/Info/Utilities/Weapons, partially Settings) and adds some tactical-style components. However, Medical appears not fully converted, and the change set also introduces multiple new non-requested features (audio player functionality, command parser expansion, new/expanded stores, boot sequence changes, and tab visibility logic changes), which go beyond a UI-only styling/animation pass.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the MEDICAL tab to use the same Tactical tab panel styling for its primary panels/sections.",
      "reason": "MedicalTab is still just a `tab-content` wrapper around `MedicalReadouts` with no visible `tactical-panel` containers in the shown diff, unlike other tabs that were wrapped in `tactical-panel` blocks.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Apply Tactical-tab-like hover/focus/active feedback and subtle transitions to comparable interactive elements across all other tabs.",
      "reason": "Some interaction polish is implied for SystemLogView/CommandConsole, but the diff evidence for other key interactive rows (e.g., module rows in Utilities, settings rows/controls) does not show added hover/transition classes or emphasis patterns; utilities module rows remain plain `module-row` with a Switch.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Standardize tab content layout spacing/scrolling conventions comparable to `.tactical-tab` (scaled by `--hud-scale`, consistent gaps, predictable overflow) across modes.",
      "reason": "Tabs are wrapped in `tab-content`, but the diff summary does not show the CSS/layout rules for `tab-content`/per-tab layouts being updated to match Tactical conventions (padding/gaps/overflow) across STANDARD and TACTICAL modes; `index.css` is truncated before any `tab-content` rules might appear.",
