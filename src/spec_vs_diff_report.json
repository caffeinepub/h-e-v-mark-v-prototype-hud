REQ-1 is fully implemented with female voice narration using Web Speech API in audioBus.ts, respecting voiceEnabled settings. REQ-2 is comprehensively implemented with enhanced visuals showing progressive system initialization stages, status indicators (pending/active/complete), progress bar, and synchronized timing with voice narration in BootSequenceOverlay.tsx.",
