  "summary": "The diff does not show any implementation changes to `HudTabsBar` or the HUD tab bar behavior. It only includes global CSS updates (not tab-specific), and metadata/summary files. As a result, both REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear unimplemented. The diff also includes unrelated styling changes (global switch styling) and project metadata updates that were not requested by the BuildRequest.",
