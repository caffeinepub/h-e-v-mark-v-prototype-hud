    title: 'Development History',
    content: 'The Hazardous Environment Suit (H.E.V.) was developed by Black Mesa Research Facility in the late 1990s to protect personnel working in extreme conditions. The suit evolved through multiple iterations, with each Mark addressing specific operational requirements and incorporating lessons learned from field deployment.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Mark Series Evolution',
    content: 'Mark I: Initial prototype with basic environmental protection. Mark II: Enhanced mobility and life support systems. Mark III: Integrated HUD and medical systems. Mark IV: Ruggedized design for hazmat operations with improved radiation shielding. Mark V: Combat-optimized variant with advanced medical systems, neural interface, and modular equipment mounting.',

  {
    title: 'Black Mesa Context',
    content: 'Black Mesa Research Facility, located in the New Mexico desert, was a top-secret government research installation focused on teleportation, dimensional physics, and exotic materials. The H.E.V. suit became standard equipment for researchers working in the Anomalous Materials laboratory and other high-risk areas of the facility.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Manufacturer Details',
    content: 'Designed and manufactured by Black Mesa\'s Advanced Protective Systems division. The suit incorporates technology from multiple defense contractors and represents billions of dollars in research and development. Each suit is custom-fitted to its operator and requires extensive training for proper use.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Notable Incidents',
    content: 'The H.E.V. suit gained legendary status during the Black Mesa Incident of 200X, when research associate Dr. Gordon Freeman survived the catastrophic resonance cascade and subsequent military intervention. The suit\'s performance during this crisis led to widespread adoption by resistance forces during the Combine occupation.',

  {
    title: 'Technical Specifications',
    content: 'Power System: 1.21 GW sustained output from compact fusion cell. Life Support: 72 hours autonomous operation. Environmental Protection: Class IV hazmat rating. Armor: Composite ceramic-titanium plating. Weight: 42 kg (distributed load). Neural Interface: Direct cortical link for HUD and system control.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Operational Doctrine',
    content: 'H.E.V. operators are trained in hazardous environment protocols, emergency response procedures, and suit maintenance. The suit is designed for solo operations in extreme conditions where conventional protective equipment would fail. Operators must maintain physical fitness standards and undergo regular medical evaluations.',
