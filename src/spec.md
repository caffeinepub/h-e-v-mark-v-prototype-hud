# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create three faction-specific HUD systems (HECU, Security, Resistance) with complete visual separation, enhanced polish, and mobile optimization.

**Planned changes:**
- Create three separate faction HUD layouts with distinct routing and view components
- Apply faction-specific color schemes (HECU green, Security blue, Resistance yellow-orange) across all UI elements
- Implement faction-specific weapon arsenals with user customization capability
- Enhance boot sequence with sequential loading text, glitch effects, and progressive system checks
- Polish tab selection with smooth transitions, hover effects, and active state indicators
- Add comprehensive keyboard shortcuts, tooltips, quick-faction switching, and auto-hide features
- Optimize all layouts for mobile devices with responsive semi-compact design
- Add professional sectioning with dividers, headers, and grouped elements
- Preserve all existing features including H.E.V Mark selection, glitch effects, and all current tabs

**User-visible outcome:** Users can select from three completely distinct faction HUDs (HECU, Security, Resistance), each with unique visual identity, color schemes, and weapon sets. The interface features polished animations, enhanced boot sequences, comprehensive keyboard shortcuts, and full mobile responsiveness while maintaining all original H.E.V Mark functionality.
